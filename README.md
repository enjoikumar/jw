JW will update once completed

triumphs:
component, and getting a structured architecutre
able to break down the psd in my head into what needs to go where

defeats:
getting images to render properly
proper styling
fonts
getting the JW player properly aligned
parsing json data

error on the json data

inputting almost the same data, finding the easiest way to do it
